# AWS-S3-Usecase
Project using AWS S3 - Course: Language of Business

## task 1
At first, the CFO would like to have a better understanding of the pros and cons of the 
AWS services. Provide a decision template for the management board (including the 
advantages and  disadvantages,  potential  risks  (if  applicable)  and  recommendations 
for each topic. 

a) How to run python in AWS? Are there several possibilities? 
b) What kind of technologies can be used as a Data Hub on AWS? 
c) Describe an AWS service for managing, sharing and deploying code! 
 
## task 2
Suddenly,  the  CFO  tells  you  to  decide  on  how  to  implement  the  pilot.  You  receive 
sample data source (csv-file). The goal is to load this csv-file into a s3 bucket called 
“z1_landing_zone”.  
 
a) Set up a “free tier” AWS account and set up the s3 Bucket 
b) Set up a Git repository so you can share the code easily with each other.  
c) Write a python script that reads the sample data from your local machine 
d) Enhance the python script, so it writes the file to the s3 bucket 
e)  Set  up  another  s3 bucket  that  represents  the  data  source.  Put  in  the  data 
manually. Enhance the python script so it can read from this bucket and write 
into the initial bucket 
e) Use Lambda to run the python script
